# Code Refactor Starter Code

Identified link for Seach Engine Optimization wasn't working and fixed by adding the id "search-engine-optimization" under <div class="content" / div class="hero-pic">, line 31

Changed <title> from "website" to "Horiseon"

Changed to semantic element <header> from div for header section

Changed to semantic element <main> from 1st <div> in body

Changed to semantic element <figure> from <div class="hero-pic"/> sections

Moved Header into Head

Condensed separate classes for "Search Engine Optinmization", "Online Reputation Managment" and "Social Media Marketing", down to one class called "hero-pic".

Condensed separate classes for "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand" and "benefit-cost" down to one class called "benefit-sub".

Added "alt" tags to all images under
  <div class="content">
  <div class="benefits">

Reorganized css style classes for better top down flow

Added @merge to make the header/h1 pixel small size if the screen is less than 1012px wide, to prevent overflow of the text in the div.
